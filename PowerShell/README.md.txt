# Overview

This room introduces **PowerShell**, a powerful command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft. Itâ€™s commonly used by system administrators and security professionals to automate tasks, manage systems, and perform penetration testing on Windows environments.

Through this room, I learned how to navigate the PowerShell environment, execute cmdlets, and interact with the Windows operating system efficiently.



# Key Topics Covered

 Understanding the PowerShell environment  
 Cmdlets (`Get-Command`, `Get-Help`, `Get-Service`, `Get-Process`)  
 File system navigation (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`)  
 Working with services and processes  
 Using pipelines and filtering (`|`, `Select-Object`, `Where-Object`)  
 Running scripts and managing execution policies  
 Remote management using `Invoke-Command`


# Commands Practiced

 List all cmdlets - `Get-Command` 
 Get help for a command - `Get-Help Get-Process` 
 View running processes - `Get-Process` 
 Check services status - `Get-Service` 
 Change directory - `Set-Location C:\` 
 Run remote command - `Invoke-Command -ComputerName RemotePC -ScriptBlock { Get-Service }` 


#  Takeaways

- PowerShell combines the flexibility of scripting with the power of the command line.  
- Cmdlets make automation easy and consistent.  
- Understanding PowerShell is essential for both **system administration** and **cybersecurity tasks** in Windows environments.
