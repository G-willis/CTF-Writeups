 Overview

This room introduces the foundational principles that guide cybersecurity — the CIA Triad, security controls, risk management, and key defensive concepts. Understanding these principles is essential before learning the technical aspects of penetration testing or system hardening.


# Key Concepts Learned

 The CIA Triad
Confidentiality: Protecting data from unauthorized access (encryption, access control).  
Integrity: Ensuring data isn’t tampered with (hashing, digital signatures).  
Availability: Keeping systems and services accessible (redundancy, backups, failover).

Security Controls

Preventive Controls: Stop attacks (firewalls, authentication, access policies).  
Detective Controls: Identify ongoing or past attacks (IDS, logs, monitoring).  
Corrective Controls: Restore systems after incidents (patching, backups, recovery tools).

 Risk Management

Threat: Something that could exploit a vulnerability.  
Vulnerability: Weakness that can be exploited.  
Risk: The potential impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.  
Mitigation: Reducing risk through controls.

 Authentication & Encryption

 Importance of strong passwords, MFA (multi-factor authentication), and least privilege access.  
 Basics of encryption and hashing for confidentiality and integrity.  

 Takeaways

 Security is a balance between usability and protection.  
 Understanding the CIA Triad helps in designing and testing secure systems.  
 Risk management is continuous — identify, evaluate, and mitigate.  
 Every control type plays a role: preventive, detective, and corrective.


 Tools/Concepts Mentioned

 Firewalls, IDS/IPS  
 Access control models (DAC, MAC, RBAC)  
 Hash functions (MD5, SHA)  
 Encryption standards (AES, RSA)
