Room Link: [Pentesting Fundamentals - TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/pentestingfundamentals?sharerId=6883d6a80aba1c8c9c8f670b)

Overview

This room introduced the core concepts of penetration testing — the process, goals, and methodologies used by ethical hackers.  
It’s designed to give beginners a structured view of how pentests are planned and executed.


Key Topics Covered

- What penetration testing is and why it’s important  
- The five stages of penetration testing:
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Scanning
  3. Gaining Access
  4. Maintaining Access
  5. Covering Tracks
- Legal and ethical boundaries  
- Tools used during each phase (e.g., Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite)  
- Report writing and documentation


Commands / Tools Learned

Nmap – for scanning and discovering hosts  
WHOIS – for domain information  
Ping / Traceroute – for network mapping  
Netcat – for simple TCP/UDP connections  
Burp Suite – for web testing  


Takeaways
- Always follow authorization and scope before testing.  
- Documentation is key — every finding should be recorded.  
- Pentesting isn’t just about hacking systems, it’s about understanding and securing them.  
- The process is systematic, not random attacks.
